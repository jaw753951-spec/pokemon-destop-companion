/**
 * The weather, the terrain and the screens — everything a battle is fought
 * inside rather than between two Pokémon.
 *
 * The auto-battle screen has always had a "field move" category and a "when
 * there is no field effect" condition, and until now there was nothing for
 * either to point at: a Sunny Day was a status move that did nothing and the
 * condition was always true. This is what they were waiting for.
 *
 * Three things live here, and they are independent of one another:
 *
 * - **Weather** covers the whole field and changes what types hit for. It runs
 *   five turns, or eight when whoever called it was holding the rock for it.
 * - **Terrain** covers the ground, so it only reaches Pokémon standing on it —
 *   a Flying type, a Levitate or a Pokémon holding an Air Balloon is above it
 *   and untouched.
 * - **Screens** belong to one side rather than to the field, and halve the
 *   damage of one damage class coming at that side.
 * - **Hazards** belong to a side too, and bite whatever is sent out onto them.
 *   The companion never switches, so the ones laid at its feet never go off —
 *   but a trainer sends out one Pokémon after another, and every one of them
 *   walks onto what was laid down for the last.
