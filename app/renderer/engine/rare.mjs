 * they come on a clock of their own instead, the way Legends: Arceus's
 * space-time distortions do: the longer since the last one, the likelier the
 * next wild Pokémon is one, until past a ceiling it certainly is.
 *
 * And a key item can decide who it is (see `CALLING_ITEMS` in the dex build):
 * the Member Card leads to Darkrai, the Silver Wing to Lugia. The Pokémon an
 * item leads to are met no other way, and while one of them is waiting the
 * clock runs to a much shorter ceiling — a ticket found is a meeting soon,
 * not one more name in a draw.
