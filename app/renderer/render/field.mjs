 * size, which puts about fifteen tiles across the window — the framing a Game
 * Boy Advance actually had, instead of twice as much map at half the size. The
 * map fills that frame, because a letterboxed strip reads as scenery instead
 * of a place. The companion is its one picture, its Black and White sprite,
 * drawn at one density for the whole dex and at one scale here.
 * And its hop is driven by distance travelled rather than by the clock, so the
 * sprite is tied to the ground the way a stepped tile-grid sprite is — speed
 * up the walk and it hops faster, stop and it settles into its standing bob.
